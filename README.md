# math-date
Making the date harder to read.

Every day in math class, instead of writing the date on the board, we write a mathematical expression that us poor
students have to evaluate in order to get the date of the month. I decided the pain of solving a ridiculous integral
only every weekday isn't enough. The end goal is to solve a ridiculous every time I open a new tab. 

I'll start by making a webpage that will mimic the behaviour of the chrome extension I hope to eventually make.
